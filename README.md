## About

Wingpanel Weather is a status indicator that displays weather status information in elementary OS Wingpanel.

Being this one of my first Vala applications I'm sure that the code can be improved, so:

- If you find any problems while running the application please report it through an issue.
- Pull requests and translations are welcome.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome as well.

### Features:

- Displays weather status
- Displays current temperature in the indicator
- Displays extended weather information in the popover including sunrise, sunset time and moon phase data.
- Automatically tries to discover your current location. Otherwise the current location name can be manually entered in the settings page.
- Notifys the user of important weather conditions change

### Requirements

- elementary OS 5.1.7 Hera
- elementary OS 6.0 Odin
- elementary OS 7.0 Horus
